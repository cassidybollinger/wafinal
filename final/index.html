<h2>What I learned </h2>
<p class="about">For the first couple weeks, I'll be completely honest, I was a quite lost. Learning Web Authoring was truly like learning a whole-nother language in itself. It was a slow process in the beginning, a lot of frustration with my website not doing whaht I wanted it to do. But now I can safely say I think I'm getting a hang of it. </p>
